# Skeleton API

The goal of this project is to create a rudimentary API that allows for rapid development of an actual API.

This project is still under development and is not ready for use in production. 

Originally a fork of [Slim-Skeleton](https://github.com/slimphp/Slim-Skeleton)

## Features
- [Slim Framework](http://www.slimframework.com)
- Laravel's [Eloquent ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/eloquent) for easy database access
- [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) for logging
- [JWTs](http://jwt.io) for user authentication
- Use the power of [Respect\Validation](https://github.com/Respect/Validation) with a simpler syntax to validate your data
- Already set up for CORS

## Install the Application

**Needs to be updated**

Run this command from the directory in which you want to install your new Slim Framework application.

    php composer.phar create-project gurpreetatwal/skeleton-api [my-app-name]

Replace `[my-app-name]` with the desired directory name for your new application. You'll want to:

* Point your virtual host document root to your new application's `public/` directory.
* Ensure `logs/` is web writeable.

That's it! Now go build something cool.
